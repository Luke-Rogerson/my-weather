# my-weather
A little application I built that asks you for your location and shows you the weather where you are.

Built to practice React, Redux and working with APIs, particularly asynchronicity.

Amaing weather icons are not mine. They are [Josh Bader's](https://codepen.io/joshbader/pen/EjXgqr).
